## Key Learning Points

* Understanding pipeline commands in Linux
* Using `sort` and `uniq` together effectively
* Why sorting is necessary before using uniq
* Basic Linux commands: `ssh`, `ls`, `sort`, `uniq`

## Additional Notes

* The process works in two steps:
  * `sort` arranges lines alphabetically
  * `uniq -u` shows only lines that appear once
* Important uniq options:
  * `-u`: show only unique lines
  * `-d`: show only duplicate lines
  * `-c`: count occurrences
* `uniq` only works properly on sorted input

## Commands Used
* `ssh` - OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)
* `ls` - List directory contents
* `sort` - Sort lines of text files
* `uniq` - Report or omit repeated lines
* `|` - Pipeline operator
