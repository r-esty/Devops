## Key Learning Points

* Using `strings` to extract readable text from binary files
* Combining `strings` with `grep` for filtering
* Understanding text processing in Linux
* Basic Linux commands: `ssh`, `ls`, `strings`, `grep`

## Additional Notes

* The `strings` command:
  * Extracts human-readable strings from binary files
  * By default, looks for sequences of 4 or more printable characters
  * Can be modified with `-n` option to change minimum length
* Common use cases for `strings`:
  * Examining binary files
  * Finding embedded text in executables
  * Forensic analysis

## Commands Used
* `ssh` - OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)
* `ls` - List directory contents
* `strings` - Print the sequences of printable characters in files
* `grep` - Print lines matching a pattern
* `|` - Pipeline operator
