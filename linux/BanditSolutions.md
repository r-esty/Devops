# OverTheWire Bandit - Level 0 & 0-1 Solution 🎮🔐

## The Goal 🎯:
The challenge asks you to access the password for the next level, which is stored in a file named `readme` on the remote server. You are provided with login credentials for the `bandit0` user.

---

## My Solution 💻:

### Step 1: Connect to the remote server 🌐
We use SSH to connect to the OverTheWire Bandit server. This is a method of logging into secure network servers from unsecure networks. The provided username is `bandit0` and the port is `2220`. The `-p` option is used to specify the port.

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

You will be prompted for a password. The password for bandit0 can be found on the OverTheWire website or in the challenge description.

### Step 2: List the files in the directory 📂
Once logged in, the first thing you want to do is list the files in the current directory to find the readme file using the `ls` command.

```bash
ls
```

This will output:

```bash
readme
```


### Step 3: View the contents of the `readme` file 📖
Now, use the `cat` command to display the contents of the `readme` file, which contains the password for the next level.

```bash
cat readme
```

### Output:

```bash

### Step 4: Note the password for the next level 🔑
The password for the next level is: ***ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If***

You will need to use this password to log in to the next level (`bandit1`).

## Takeaways 📚:
1. **Using `ssh` for remote access** 🌍: In the real world, `ssh` (Secure Shell) is commonly used to connect to remote servers securely. It’s vital for DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers to be comfortable with using `ssh` for managing remote systems.

2. **Navigating files with `ls` and `cat`** 🧭: Understanding basic commands like `ls` (to list files) and `cat` (to display the content of a file) is essential for working with files in Linux-based systems. These commands are useful for troubleshooting, exploring system directories, and retrieving configuration files or logs.

3. **Basic Linux file operations** 🖥️: This challenge is a reminder of how simple commands are essential for interacting with files on a Unix-like system. Whether for system administration, automation, or development, knowing how to efficiently use these commands is a core skill for anyone working with Linux-based infrastructure.

By completing this level, you not only advance in the game but also reinforce foundational skills that will be invaluable in real-world DevOps, IT operations, and security roles. 🚀
