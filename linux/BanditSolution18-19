# Over The Wire: Bandit Level 18 â†’ Level 19

## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a readme file in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out upon login.

## Solution

### Step 1: Execute Remote Command
Since interactive login is blocked, use SSH to execute command directly:
```bash
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme
```

Password for next level:
```
cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8
```

## Key Commands
* `ssh user@host command`: Execute command remotely via SSH
* `cat`: Display file contents

## Notes
* `.bashrc` modification prevents interactive login
* SSH allows remote command execution without shell access
* Command executes before `.bashrc` is loaded
