## Overview  
The **Bash Battle Arena** is a fun and interactive command-line game designed to teach and improve Bash scripting skills. Each level presents a unique challenge, requiring players to write Bash scripts to solve problems ranging from simple file manipulations to complex system operations.  

### Objective  
The goal is to "defeat" each level by successfully completing the tasks using Bash scripts. The ultimate aim is to become a **Bash Master.**  

As part of my Bash learning, I have documented the solutions for all 15 levels in this file, detailing the steps I followed, challenges I faced, and how I overcame them.
