## Overview  
The **Bash Battle Arena** is a fun and interactive command-line game designed to teach and improve Bash scripting skills. Each level presents a unique challenge, requiring players to write Bash scripts to solve problems ranging from simple file manipulations to complex system operations.  

### Objective  
The goal is to "defeat" each level by successfully completing the tasks using Bash scripts. The ultimate aim is to become a **Bash Master.**  

As part of my Bash learning journey, I have recorded the solutions for all 15 levels in this file, outlining the steps I took, the challenges I encountered, and how I resolved them.

## Level 1: The Basics  
### Mission  
Create a directory named `Arena` and inside it, create three files: `warrior.txt`, `mage.txt`, and `archer.txt`. List the contents of the `Arena` directory.  

### Solution  
```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir Arena
cd Arena
touch warrior.txt mage.txt archer.txt
ls

```



### Explanation  
This script begins by creating a new directory called **Arena** using the `mkdir` command. It then navigates into the **Arena** directory using `cd`. After that, the `touch` command is used to create three empty text files: `warrior.txt`, `mage.txt`, and `archer.txt`. Finally, the `ls` command lists the contents of the **Arena** directory to verify that the files were successfully created.


# Mission: Print Numbers from 1 to 10

## **Objective**  
Create a Bash script that outputs the numbers **1 to 10**, one number per line.

---

## **Solution: Using a For Loop**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Loop from 1 to 10
for i in {1..10}
do
  echo $i  # Print the current number
done
Explanation
The script starts with #!/bin/bash, which ensures the script runs in Bash.
The for loop iterates through numbers 1 to 10 using {1..10}.
On each iteration:
The variable i takes the next number in the sequence.
The echo $i command prints the value of i.
The loop continues until i reaches 10, ensuring that numbers 1-10 are printed.
